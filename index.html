<h2>About Sarah</h2>

<p>Sarah is a singer who has been performing since a young age, initially in musical theatre and choral music. During her later school years, she was a member of Scat, a highly successful jazz choir with whom she toured throughout Asia and Australia. She has also sung in a competing barbershop quartet and played double bass and sang in many bands including the jazz orchestra.</p>

<p>In 2009, Sarah was awarded a Massey University High Achievers Arts Scholarship which she used to study jazz vocals at the New Zealand School of Music. During her study for the Bachelor of Music she also continued her double bass training and studied theory, arranging, composing and transcription.</p>

<p>Sarah has been teaching vocals, working with choirs and transcribing and arranging music. She plays regular gigs and continues to work on her original compositions. She has studied different vocal techniques and their applications in order to increase her versatility and enhance her teaching ability. Sarah is keen to share her love of music and to use the skills she has acquired to help others develop their singing.</p>
