<h1>Lessons</h1>

<p>Lesson plans are made to suit the student and their experience and style. Whether you are a beginner who likes to sing in the shower, or an experienced singer who is already performing regularly or wants to compete, Sarah will help you achieve your goals in a fun and motivating way. Regular concerts are held to provide students with the opportunity to improve their performance skills.</p>

<p>The structure of lessons includes learning technical warm ups to strengthen and limber up the voice  and extend vocal range. Sarah’s guidance in mastering vocal techniques and their applications complements the learning and performance of songs of your chosen genre. Musical theory, composition, sight singing and arranging will also be taught at the student’s request.</p>

<p>Lessons are currently either held at the Orakei community centre or Sarah will come to you and teach in your own home. Sarah is looking at extending and finding other centres to teach from.</p>

<h2>Solo</h2>

<p>Solo lessons are great for all singers as the lessons are tailored just for you and what you want to learn. You could be a casual singer, who sings purely for enjoyment, or a serious singer, who sets goals to work towards with your teacher; your exact needs will be catered for.</p>

<h2>Group (max. of 3 per group)</h2>

<p>Group lessons are great for beginners, younger kids and people with less confidence as learning to sing with one or two friends can make it easier for some people to come out of their shells. You can either choose your own group or you can be placed in a group with students of similar age and experience.</p>
