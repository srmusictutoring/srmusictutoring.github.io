Regular concerts are held to provide students with the opportunity to improve their performance skills.</p>

<p class="flow-text">The structure of lessons includes learning technical warm ups to strengthen and limber up the voice and extend vocal range. Sarah’s guidance in mastering vocal techniques and their applications complements the learning and performance of songs of your chosen genre. Musical theory, composition, sight singing and arranging will also be taught at the student’s request.</p>
